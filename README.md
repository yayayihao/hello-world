review for operating of github

I have come here Beijing for 7 dyas, however, I find that it's not easy as previously thought. 
So I have to work harder and I believe that I will find a suitable job for me!

I have to adjust my mind to get through this sensitive period.
In stepping into a new industry, it's necessary to pay more. Everything is difficult at the beginning.
